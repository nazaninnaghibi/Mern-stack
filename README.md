I have created a review page for a company using MERN Stack which it stands for (MongoDB, Express,Redux, Node.js) that if its customers would like to create, modify or delete their own feedback or even they want to like others feedback, must sign up first, or if they already registered, they should sign in, otherwise all of those things will be inactive, so both authorization and authentication are applied on this page.

Main Panel:

Customer Panel. It can recognize how is the user and display its name on the top of the page:

Creating a new feedback by a user, now with authorization and authentication user can create, delete, update its own feedback and like others people's feedback.
